It looks very organized and easy to read. But l like the layout of dashboard D. Just too much yellow. ,

Most important as well would be seeing deadlines but it’s usually up to how lazy the prof is in terms of adding dates. ,,Year 4,"Business Administration double degree (WLU or WLU & UW)",I like the side bar if it can be collapsible so I can have more screen space.
