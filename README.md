The Lazaridis School of Business & Economics at Wilfrid Laurier University’s Start-Up Lab was contracted by the professors of BU354, Human Resources Management, to build a dashboard for their weekly assignments. This document summarizes the design decisions made for this project. 

The design process was led by Derek Song, a co-op student working under under the Laurier Start-Up Lab. After getting the opinions of more than 59 students, the resulting platform features a collapsible sidebar aligned with Laurier’s visual identity and an interface inspired by MyLearningSpace, Google Docs, and Laurier Navigator. The home dashboard prioritizes upcoming deadlines, and Dashboard A (tested against 7 other medium-fidelity prototypes) will be further refined based on strong student preference.
 
Graphs can be found in the `/pdfs` folder, raw data is found in the `.csv` folders at root, and Python functions to assist with statistical hypothesis testing and graph generation is done through Python in the `main.py` file. 

# Deliverables 
The final report is stored in the `/BU354 Comparative Usability Report with High-Fidelity Prototypes and Formulas.pdf` on root, with the formula sheet located at `/formuale.pdf` on root.
Additionally, there are two Figma prototype links:
